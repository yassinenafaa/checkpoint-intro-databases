Slide 1: Introduction to MongoDB vs SQL
Title: Introduction to MongoDB (NoSQL) vs SQL Databases

What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-based database.
Stores data in flexible, JSON-like format (BSON).
Scales horizontally for high performance and large datasets.
What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases use a relational model.
Data is stored in tables with fixed schema.
SQL databases are vertically scalable and rely on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
Slide 2: MongoDB - Key Features
Title: Key Features of MongoDB

Document-Oriented:

Stores data in collections of JSON-like documents (BSON).
Flexible schema design allows for easy updates.
Scalability:

Horizontal scaling through sharding (data distributed across multiple servers).
Ideal for handling large-scale, high-velocity data.
Querying:

Supports rich, flexible queries including aggregation, text search, and geospatial queries.
Schema-less:

Data can have different structures within the same collection.
Slide 3: SQL - Key Features
Title: Key Features of SQL Databases

Relational Model:
Data stored in tables with rows and columns, where each table represents an entity.
ACID Transactions:
Ensures strong consistency and reliability for transactional applications.
Structured Query Language (SQL):
A powerful and standardized language for querying and managing data.
Fixed Schema:
Data must conform to a predefined schema, with strong data types for each column.
Slide 4: MongoDB vs SQL - Comparison
Title: Comparison Between MongoDB and SQL Databases

Feature	MongoDB (NoSQL)	SQL Databases
Data Model	Document-based (JSON/BSON)	Relational (Tables, Rows, Columns)
Schema	Schema-less (flexible)	Fixed schema (strict structure)
Scalability	Horizontal (Sharding)	Vertical (Scaling up, scaling out is complex)
Query Language	MongoDB Query Language (MQL)	Structured Query Language (SQL)
Transactions	Supports multi-document ACID transactions	Full ACID support for multi-row, multi-table transactions
Use Case	Large-scale, unstructured data, real-time apps	Structured data, complex queries, transactional systems
Slide 5: When to Use MongoDB vs SQL
Title: When to Choose MongoDB vs SQL

Use MongoDB if:

You need flexible, schema-less data storage.
Your data is large, unstructured, or semi-structured.
You require horizontal scaling and high throughput for large datasets.
Use cases include: real-time analytics, IoT, content management, and social media applications.
Use SQL if:

You need strong data integrity and consistency.
Your data is structured and you have complex queries and joins.
You require robust support for transactions (banking, e-commerce).
Use cases include: financial systems, enterprise applications, and legacy systems.
